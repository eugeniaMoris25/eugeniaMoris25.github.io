    <section id="about">
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Ever since I can remember, I've been drawn to the challenges of puzzles and the ever-evolving world of technology. In 2019, as I wrapped up my undergraduate studies, I delved into the realm of artificial intelligence for my final project. The potential and impact of this technology fascinated me, leading me to pursue further studies in the scientific field, specifically focusing on artificial intelligence.</p>
    
        <p>Currently, my work revolves around the segmentation of the optic disc and cup, aiming to detect diseases for those who may find it challenging to visit a doctor. My goal is to provide a diagnostic tool to individuals, ensuring accessibility to healthcare.</p>
    
        <p>When it comes to mental challenges, I approach them uniquely. I believe in tackling problems with a positive attitude, as it allows me to navigate challenges with a proactive mindset. To me, maintaining positivity isn't just a perspective; it's a powerful tool to address problems effectively.</p>
